# phase-1-project
phase 1 project TV Showz

Welcome to TVMaze! The concept is pretty simple. Find a show, click on the 'see more' button to read the summary and hover over the ♥ and find the ratings.

HOW IT WORKS
double click on the show image to zoom in
click on the see more button to see more about a specific show.click on the see less button and the summary disappears.
hover over the ♥ to see the show's ratings. hover back and it disapears.

IN THE FUTURE
additional features would be to have a filter option to filter the shows by genres. Hopely in the next iteration of this project
